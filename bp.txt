Client Imaging
My target client group will be Chinese Americans who are first- or second-generation immigrants and have a deep Chinese cultural background and are currently using private wealth/retail wealth services but not receiving exceptional service.
Customer Base Analysis and My Focus
According to the most recent research, the Chinese Americans population in the Greater Chicago area has grown from 144,903 in 2010 to 189,857 with a 31% increase over 10 years in 2020 (2.7% annually), which leads me to an estimate that the population in 2023 is 205,888. With the recent data from 2020, 4.5% of American households have a net worth of more than 3 million. With a general household size of 2.5 people, we are looking at a potential client base range from 3,700 to 4,000 in only the Greater Chicago area, based on the growth of wealth and inflation within the last three years and with an annual increase of 50 to 60 households.
Client groups I will be in touch with are local business owners with asset allocation needs between the mainland and the US, or family trusts with funds from the mainland in need of reliable investment support.
My Strengths
Born and raised in a Mainland Chinese culture and having spent 7 years studying and living in the US, I have a deeper understanding of the financial and personal needs of the Chinese American group. Instead of only providing clients with a financial solution, a more exceptional family office service can be offered to my clients based on their needs. Also, with my educational background and knowledge, I can provide clients with overseas businesses a more in-depth outlook on both markets.
How I Will Acquire My First 10 million and Initial Marketing Plan
I will roll out the marketing materials as a brand-new Mandarin-speaking service and give the first initial reach out to clients with emails and highlighting myself as one of the first Chinese American targeted private wealth service in Midwest.
New family households moving into Chicago will be my main resource for businesses that were using a Chinese family office service and are seeking a new one based on location. 
I will also reach out to Asian business community leaders and business owners, understand the current services they are using, and introduce the exceptional experience and relationship I could offer to create conversions.
Weaknesses
I'm new to the industry and lack experience in financial advisory.
Market Penetration
Morgan Stanley currently has about 18 Mandarin-speaking financial advisors in the New York area and 36 in California. In the mid-west area, there are two Mandarin-speaking FAs for general advisory in Naperville, and very little penetration here in the Midwest for Asian American ultra-high net worth client groups.
Based on the one pager before, here are more detailed demographics and client imaging for Asian America clients. Also, a couple of samples will be picked from the group to show the strategy on reaching out.
Chinese
This group will be my main target for the development of the book of business. Most of the Chinese resident in Illinois gather in Chicago, Naperville, and Champaign. Multiple business community is based in Chicago of the Chinese American community, including FBAUSA (Fu Jian Business Association), Chicago Chinatown chamber of commerce, HKC ( Hongkong Club). There are other locally based business community such as Columbus Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Midwest USA Chinese Chamber of Commerce, etc.
Business owners in Midwest area which can reach a network over 3 million are mainly grouped in retail, logistics, catering industry and real estate development. Potential clients are mainly retail service developers who need investment management on the assets. Sample
Eddie Ni (LinkedIn page: https://www.linkedin.com/in/eddie-ni-01b4119/)
Currently base in Richfield, Ohio, Eddie Ni is the chairman of windfall group which is a real-estate development company currently runs 15 projects across 10 states and one-third of them are based in IL. The president has seeked for investment opportunities on his asset through starting the investment division Goldenstone(GDSTU) in the group and get listed on Nasdaq. The company merged with a crypto payment company on Jun21, 2022 and has no volume on the market. As the attempt on investment did not reach a great success, I believe the client may in need for professional investment for his personal assets and future business development at the same time.
Approach Strategy
Reach out to the client in a professional way and the initial conversation can be focused on his business in real estate and my personal experience related to it. The service will mainly focus on his investment management on the firm asset and business financing and planning support.
Gary Chen
Gary Chen is the CEO of PARK TO SHOP, which is an Asian retail chain store mainly base in Chicago and Ohio. Company owners actively attend community meetings and recently celebrate the annual meeting. The report on the annual meeting leads me to believe that the company is currently running at great condition and the increase in wealth will lead the client to wealth management demand.
Approach Strategy
Reach out to the client for an in-person meeting. I can relate personal experiences with the client and provide the client with suggestions on the business. The service will focus on his wealth management and support on local market research for development and competition. 


Japanese & Korean

These ethnicity group gathers at Arlington Heights, mainly around the Mitsuwa Marketplace and the Mitsubishi factory which is considered the Japanese town area. The population of the group is considerably smaller and there is no namable business community in this area. Most of the residents are factory workers or restaurant workers. The largest business community organization is JASC ( Japan America Society of Chicago). The organization is in an active status organization multiple events within the community focusing on local Japanese business development and has great networking with local high network Japanese American.
